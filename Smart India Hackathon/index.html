        <div>
            <p>
                In pursuit of equitable and inclusive education, our platform serves
                as a comprehensive tool for analyzing and addressing the critical
                issue of student dropout rates in school education. We recognize that
                dropout rates are influenced by a myriad of socio-economic factors,
                and it is our mission to provide data-driven insights to inform policy
                decisions and drive focused interventions.

            Our website is dedicated to empowering policymakers, educators, and
            stakeholders with valuable insights through in-depth analysis of student
            dropout rates. We focus on four crucial categories for analysis<br />

            interventions and resource allocation.<br />
            • Gender-wise Analysis: Examine the gender disparities in dropout rates and create gender-sensitive policies
            to ensure equal access to education.<br />
            • Caste-wise Analysis: Address social inequalities by analyzing dropout rates among different caste groups
            and devising strategies for inclusive education.<br />
            • Age/Standard-wise Analysis: Identify critical stages where dropouts are most prevalent, enabling timely
            interventions and support.<br />
